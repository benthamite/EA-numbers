* Downloading for the first time
If you never used the deck before, you can download it straight away from [[https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1810848608][AnkiWeb]].

* Upgrading to the latest version
If you are already using a version of the deck and would like to upgrade to the latest version, you first need to install the [[https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki][CrowdAnki]] add-on:

1. Open Anki on your computer and select /Tools/ > /Add-ons/ > /Get Add-ons/.
2. Paste the code ~1788670778~ and click /OK/.
3. Restart Anki.

You're now ready to upgrade:

1. Go to the [[https://github.com/benthamite/EA-numbers/releases][Releases]] page.
2. Under /Assets/, download the file ~EA-numbers.zip~.
3. Extract the contents of the file to your computer.
4. Open Anki and make sure your devices are all synchronized.
5. Select /File/ > /CrowdAnki: Import from disk/.
6. Browse for and select the folder you extracted, named ~EA-numbers~.
7. Don't change anything in the CrowdAnki Import Settings dialog box that opensâ€”just press OK to start the import. A dialog box should then confirm that the import was successful.

* Building the deck from the source file
The deck is created by pushing the contents of an org mode file to the Anki desktop app (with the [[https://github.com/louietan/anki-editor][anki-editor Emacs package]]); exporting the generated deck to a JSON file (with the [[https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki][CrowdAnki Anki add-on]]); and uploading this file to the current repository. If you are an Emacs user, you can simplify the process by creating the deck directly from the [[https://github.com/benthamite/EA-numbers/blob/main/source.org][source file]]. (Please note that you need to delete the lines starting with ~:ANKI_NOTE_ID:~ under each main heading; otherwise anki-editor will emit an error message.)

In case it is of interest, here is my anki-editor configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
