Rushby et al. (2018) estimate carbon dioxide depletion will occur in around 800 million years for C3 photosynthesis, and around 500 million years later for C4 photosynthesis.\n\n\n\"Over such long timespans, we cannot ignore the possibility that evolution may lead to new life forms able to exist in climates inhospitable to presently existing life forms.

Given its fundamental economic role, policy analysts have adopted the VSL as the economically correct measure of the benefit individuals receive from enhancements to their health and safety. Estimates of the VSL for the United States are around $10 million ($2017), and estimates for other countries are generally lower given the positive income elasticity of the VSL.\" (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780190625979.013.138\">Kniesner &amp; Viscusi 2019</a>)\n",
